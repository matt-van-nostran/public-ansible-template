# Playbooks

Documentation for how to use Ansible playbooks can be found on the
[working with playbooks](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks.html)
webpage.

I would place your ad-hoc Ansible playbooks here. You may also keep them
in the root of the repository, depending on your needs, but I'd reserve that
space for playbooks intended for performing more common or necessary functions
such as calling roles or necessary tasks for your desired state.
